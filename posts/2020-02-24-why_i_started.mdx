I have always been interested in computers and what they could do from a young age. The fact that anything can be done from programming from simply making a program that writes something in a terminal all the way to creating new worlds. I tried to start right out of high school but didn't make it far in a for profit school. I still learned and kept up with sites like codewars or new apis. Then I was introduced to bootcamps like Flatiron which is where I will finally realize my dream of being a software developer
