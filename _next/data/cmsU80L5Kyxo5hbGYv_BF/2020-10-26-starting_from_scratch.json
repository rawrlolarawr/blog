Everyother programming language I've encountered has had best practices and guidelines to follow when programming and as a creature of habit this is something I relied on heavily. However, enter stage right is Javascript, or the wild wild west of programming where there's always another way to complete something you're working on.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Lets begin with the biggest thing JS has to offer, functions. You have a variable? That's a function. You have an argument to a function? That's also a function. This concept took awhile to click but once it does it allows a lot of abstraction as JS treats functions as first class data just like the primitive datatypes.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"While JS seems complicated, its simplicity is what causes it. JS has a very small number of primitive types and nothing is type casted meaning you can do 1+1 and get 2 or 1+'two' and get '1two'. Coming from Java, Ruby, and .NET this is a big change and takes a lot to get used to.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"So... onto my project.
