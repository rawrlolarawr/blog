Welcome to my Sinatra web app where design was an implied requirement.</p><p>Luckily there are many frameworks such as bootstrap that can help you through designing the looks of your application. However, to try and get a better grasp of <em>being creative</em> I decided to skip the framework and use vanilla css to get my app how I wanted.</p><p>To build my app I used a gem made by a Flatiron graduate called Corneal which gave me my file system and a basic barebones app to build off of. When I started to style my app I noticed there was a file in my stylesheets already. I figured that this was it I don&#x27;t need anymore design to go into this. However, I was wrong so I had to dip my feet into CSS.</p><p>The gem gave me 2 breakpoints one for the screen and one if the screen is under 600px. This was using <code>@media screen</code> do determine the size of the screen the app was using from there it gave me some reset styles and the rest was up to me.</p><p>Fortunately, the content of my app was styled and the background matched the icon I was using. This means all I have to do is the navbar which still turned out to be quite the hassle getting it to look nice.</p><pre><code>&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;navbar&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/favicon.ico&quot; alt=&quot;Teddy Bear Repair Logo&quot;&gt;
      &lt;% if logged_in? %&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/user/dashboard&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/user/dashboard/edit&quot;&gt;Edit User&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/logout&quot;&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;% else %&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/login&quot;&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/user/new&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre><p>This is what I had to work with. A simple div containing links and the logo. Easy enough I figured I could do it all in the nav selector. well theres a little more that would go into it.</p><p>To get a nice background for the bar I added it to the nav selector. I also got rid of padding, margin, and overflow.</p><pre><code>nav {
    background: #eee;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    overflow: none;
}
</code></pre><p>Then moving on to make sure everything was nice and centered I added a flex display to the div inside</p><pre><code>nav div.navbar {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}
</code></pre><p>Now at this point I have a bar with a white background with some links going across it. At this point I need to style the links so lets move on to the selector nav a</p><pre><code>nav a {
    display: block;
    color: #333;
    padding: 16px;
    text-decoration: none;
}
</code></pre><p>Here I set the display to block which makes the whole area clickable and the text color to black with a padding of 16px on each block. I also removed any text decoration.</p><p>At this point everything is looking nice but it could be a little better so lets invert the link when hovered over. Luckily, CSS makes this very simple with its relative selectors making something like this possible </p><pre><code>nav a:hover {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #eee;
}
</code></pre><p>So that was nice and painless and makes me ready to move forward with a little more <em>creative</em> elements in my future projects.</p></div></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontMatter":{"title":"Engineering Design","date":"June 15th, 2020","description":"Front end design","tags":["functions","javascript"]},"slug":"2020-06-15-engineering_design","mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"var h=Object.defineProperty,c=Object.defineProperties;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors;var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols;var r=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,s=Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable;var d=(e,a,t)=\u003ea in e?h(e,a,{enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0,value:t}):e[a]=t,n=(e,a)=\u003e{for(var t in a||(a={}))r.call(a,t)\u0026\u0026d(e,t,a[t]);if(i)for(var t of i(a))s.call(a,t)\u0026\u0026d(e,t,a[t]);return e},p=(e,a)=\u003ec(e,m(a));var l=(e,a)=\u003e{var t={};for(var o in e)r.call(e,o)\u0026\u0026a.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026(t[o]=e[o]);if(e!=null\u0026\u0026i)for(var o of i(e))a.indexOf(o)\u003c0\u0026\u0026s.call(e,o)\u0026\u0026(t[o]=e[o]);return t};const layoutProps={},MDXLayout=\"wrapper\";function MDXContent(t){var o=t,{components:e}=o,a=l(o,[\"components\"]);return mdx(MDXLayout,p(n(n({},layoutProps),a),{components:e,mdxType:\"MDXLayout\"}),mdx(\"p\",null,\"If you are reading this I can only assume you are and engineer and design is the bane of your existence.
